    <h1>What We Offer</h1>
    <P>We are in our shop 3 days a week. Monday, Friday, and Saturday. Feel free to drop by if you have any questions or call us at (123) 456-7890. We would love to see your car and have the opportunity to tune it in the future. 
    </P>
    <P>We provide both a tuning service and a building service. We are experts when it comes to building and tuning cars so you can leave it to us. We have been building cars since the 90s and have grown with the cars and culture as they have grown throughout the years. There is no task that is too big or small for us to conquer. If you have any questions regarding our building services please contact Leroy at (098) 765-4321.
    </P>
