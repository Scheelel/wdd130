    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <P>We are a small and local business and family-owned business that has been building tuner cars for over 2 decades and have been tuning for a little over 5 years. We have plenty of experience with Japanese cars and our specialty is Subarus. We are based out of Bentonville Arkansas and have been supporting the local car community for years. We hope that you choose us as your next tuning stop and we wish you the best.
    </P>
    <p>It is sometimes hard to find someone that you trust with your car. We all know of shady dealers of mechanics who will attempt to grift you of all the money that you have. Rest assured that we have both your car and wallet in mind when it comes to our business. We charge only $250 for a tune and for each subsequent request, we will reduce the price down to $200. We know how hard you have worked for your money and how precious your time is so we do our best to ensure that we have the fastest turnaround time and the best quality.
    </p>
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <P>We started our business in early 2016 and we mainly bought, fixed, and resold cars. After a few years, we realized that our real passion was building and tuning cars. We pivoted then and have been building and tuning cars ever since. We love what we do now and wish to share this passion with you as you come and experience what we have to offer.
    </P>
