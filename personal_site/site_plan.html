        It is sometimes hard to find someone that you trust with your car. We all know of shady dealers of mechanics who will attempt to grift you of all the money that you have. Rest assured that we have both your car and wallet in mind when it comes to our business. We charge only $250 for a tune and for each subsequent request, we will reduce the price down to $200. We know how hard you have worked for your money and how precious your time is so we do our best to ensure that we have the fastest turnaround time and the best quality.

        Meet our employees:
Leroy has been building cars since he was 14 and has almost 40 years of experience working on cars. He is an expert when it comes to both foreign and domestic cars and has a knack for the older variety. He enjoys most cars and loves to build and race them. Leroy has also been tuning cars since the early 2000s. He has extensive knowledge of how to tune Hondas and Subarus. Landon is our new employee. He has been building cars since he was 15 years old and loves to work on Subarus. He also has extensive knowledge of Honda, Ford, and VW. He has recently come to work as a resident tuner and is an expert when it comes to tuning Subarus. If you would like to get in contact with either of them please contact (123) 456-7890.

Our history:
We started our business in early 2016 and we mainly bought, fixed, and resold cars. After a few years, we realized that our real passion was building and tuning cars. We pivoted then and have been building and tuning cars ever since. We love what we do now and wish to share this passion with you as you come and experience what we have to offer.
